Part 1: Opening SPSS 
- Open SPSS
- Double click “New Dataset”
Part 2: Creating CDF for a Binomial(n = 15, p = 0.4) random variable
- Go to the Variable View tab on the empty spreadsheet
- Type two variables under the “Name” column: X and CDF 
- Set “Measure” to “Scale” for both 
- Increase “Width” of the CDF variable to 10
- Set “Decimals” to 0 for X and 8 for CDF 
- Switch back to the Data View tab
- Enter the numbers 0 through 15 in the X column
- Transform > Compute Variable
- Type “CDF” under Target Variable 
- Under “Function Group”, click “CDF & Non-Central CDF” 
- Under “Functions and Special Variables”, double click Cdf.Binom  
- Replace “?, ?, ?” with “X, 15, 0.4” and press OK. Include a screenshot of the CDF column for A3.

Part 3: Creating CDF for a Poisson(mu = 3) random variable
- File > New > Data 
- Repeat the first 10 steps from part 3 (but enter 0 through 30 in the X column rather than 0 through 15)
- Under “Functions and Special Variables”, double click Cdf.Poisson
- Replace “?, ?” with “X, 3” and press OK. Include a screenshot of the CDF column for A3. (Note: If you can’t fit the entire column in your screenshot, just include the first 18 rows, up to when the CDF becomes 1.00000000)
